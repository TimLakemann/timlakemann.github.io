This work presents a scalable and fast method for deploying Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms. Decentralized large-scale aerial swarms rely on onboard sensing to achieve reliable relative localization in real-world conditions. In heterogeneous research and industrial platforms, the adaptability of the individual UAVs enables rapid deployment in diverse mission scenarios. However, frequent platform reconfiguration often requires time-consuming sensor calibration and validation, which introduces significant delays and operational overhead. To overcome this, we propose a method that enables rapid deployment and calibration of vision-based UAV swarms in real-world environments.
