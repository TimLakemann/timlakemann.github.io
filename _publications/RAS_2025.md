A novel onboard tracking approach enabling vision-based relative localization and communication using Active blinking Marker Tracking (AMT) is introduced in this article. Active blinking markers on multi-robot team members improve the robustness of relative localization for aerial vehicles in tightly coupled multi-robot systems during real-world deployments, while also serving as a resilient communication system. Traditional tracking algorithms struggle with fast-moving blinking markers due to their intermittent appearance in camera frames and the complexity of associating multiple of these markers across consecutive frames. AMT addresses this by using weighted polynomial regression to predict the future appearance of active blinking markers while accounting for uncertainty in the prediction. In outdoor experiments, the AMT approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in tracking density, accuracy, and complexity. The experimental validation of this novel tracking approach for relative localization and optical communication involved testing motion patterns motivated by our research on agile multi-robot deployment.
