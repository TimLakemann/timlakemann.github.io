Reflections of active markers in the environment are a common source of ambiguity in onboard visual relative localization. This work presents a novel approach for onboard relative localization in multi-robot teams that exploits these typically unwanted reflections of active markers in the environment. It operates without prior knowledge of robot size or predefined marker configurations and remains independent of surface properties, an essential feature for heterogeneous micro-aerial swarms cooperating in unknown environments. It explicitly accounts for uncertainties caused by non-flat surfaces, with a particular focus on dynamic water surfaces, which are especially relevant for marine deployments. We validated the approach in both indoor and outdoor experiments, demonstrating that the proposed reflection-based localization system operates reliably without prior knowledge of team member size and achieves greater effective range (above 30 m) and accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. The video and source code of this work will be made publicly available after publication.
